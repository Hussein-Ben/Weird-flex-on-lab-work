# term-2-lab-hfark001
my term 2 lab work, the intranet virtual servers do not work for me.

I have followed along with the lab exercises and read all the code.

Back-end development is not what I want speicialise in, but nevertheless I've tried my best to understand the code, I know the exam will be based on understanding the lab exerises.

I Have not built the app.
